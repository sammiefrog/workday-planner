## Description
This is a daily planner for a typical work day. It is coded for 8am to 4pm, my ideal workday, but it can be easily adjusted. The input field can save to local storage and be deleted when a task is completed. Also, the current hour is shown in yellow, future hours are blue, and past hours turn red.

## Technology Stack
HTML, Bootstrap, JQuery, Moment.js

## Usage
To track daily tasks during your work day, you can save and delete tasks, and the time slots turn red as that hour passes.
